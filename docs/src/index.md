# PhyloNetworks.jl

[PhyloNetworks](https://github.com/crsl4/PhyloNetworks.jl)
is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package for the
manipulation, visualization, inference of phylogenetic networks,
and their use for trait evolution.

## How to get help

- the package [wiki](https://github.com/crsl4/PhyloNetworks.jl/wiki) has a step-by-step
  tutorial, done for the 2018 MBL workshop, with background on networks and
  explanations.
- the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/phylonetworks-users)
  has answers to common questions.
- the Manual below has a quick tutorial (navigation on the left).
- the [Index](@ref main-index) further below has the full list of documented functions.
